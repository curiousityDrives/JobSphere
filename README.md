## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

    ```

3. Set up MongoDB:
    - If youâ€™re using a local MongoDB instance, make sure MongoDB is running.
    - If you prefer to use MongoDB Atlas, update the `mongoose.connect()` URI in `app.js` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.

4. Add the `jobspy` module and any other necessary Python packages for web scraping.

5. Set up environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
      ```env
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
      API_KEY=your_resume_parser_api_key
      ```
